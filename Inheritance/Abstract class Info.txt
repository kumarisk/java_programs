Abtract class
=>1) we declare abstract keyword before class defination,then such class is known as Abstract class.
2) It is a partially implemented and partially unimplemented structure.
3) As it is partially implemented and partially unimplemented structure,Abstract class contains implemented methods as well as unimplemented methods.
4) we can't create object of an abstract class,bcz it is a partially unimplemented structure.
5)Abstract class contains abstract methods,if we use abstract keyword before method declaration then such method is known as abstract method,it does not have method defination.
6) We can assign reference to an abstract class object.
7) It is used to implements dynamic polymorphism
8) syntax of creating abstract class is as follows
    public abstract class <class_name>
	{
	  abstract methods
	  non-abstract methods
	}
e.g
 public abstract class Person
 { 
      public abstract void info();
	  public void display()
	 {
	  System.out.println("\nFrom display method");
	 }
 }
