Inheritance
1) creating a new class from an existing class is  called as inheritance.
2) Java implements inheritance using extends keyword.
3) A class which extends another class is called sub class or child class or derived class.
4) A class which extended to another class is called base class parent class or super class
5) In sub class we can acces all the public,protected and default members of super class.
6) we can't access private members of super class in sub class.
7) syntax of creating sub class or derived class
    <sub-classs> extends <super-class>
     {
       

     }
e.g
  class Student extends Person
   {

    }
where,
  Student is a sub class
  Person is a super class
