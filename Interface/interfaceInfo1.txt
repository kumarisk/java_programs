Inteface
syntax
interface <Interface_name>
{
   //static / final variables
    abstract methods
	
}
Note:
1) Interface in java is used using keyword interface
2) It is pure abstract class
3) It contains only abstract methods
4) It does not contains non-abstract methods
5) all variables of interface are final and static by nature
6) we no need to use static or final keyword for variables of interface
7) methods are by nature abstract,since we need not use abstract keyword before method declarations
8) default access specifier of interface is of public 
9) A class implements interface using "implements" keyword
10) A class which implements an inetrface is known as Implementing class and must overide all abstract methods of an interface.
11) we cant create object of interface
12) Inteface is fully unimplemented structure
