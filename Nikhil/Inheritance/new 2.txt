Arithmetic operation on pointers
Only 2 arithmetic operations are allowed on pointers
1.Addition
2.Substraction
1.Addition
we can perform arithmetic operation on pointers
we cannot add two pointers directly because this will create a range error
we add a small value in a pointer variable

2.Substraction
we can perform substraction on pointers directly
we can also substract small value from pointers
because substraction will decrease the address whic will not go out of range

Note:
We cannot use * and / on pointers whic creates range problems
